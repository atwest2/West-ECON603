\section*{Literature Review}

The literature on broadband infrastructure and educational outcomes is broad and interdisciplinary, spanning work in education economics, public finance, and information technology policy. Three areas are particularly relevant to the 2014 E-Rate modernization: (i) the effects of digital access and technology adoption on human capital formation, (ii) the role of infrastructure investments in school environments and learning outcomes, and (iii) the persistence of the digital divide and heterogeneity in broadband access.

\textbf{Technology, Connectivity, and Human Capital Formation.} The role of education in human capital formation is an important part of economic theory, with \citet{mincer1974} and \citet{hanushek2012} establishing foundational links between schooling duration, cognitive skill development, and economic growth at both individual and national levels. As education increasingly integrates digital technologies, broadband access and speed have emerged as potential avenues for enhancing human capital, though the literature reveals mixed evidence on their effectiveness.

\textit{Broadband Access.}  Research shows that broadband availability can shape educational opportunities through development of skills and enhanced learning activities. Studies such as \citet{hazlett2019}, \citet{dettling2015}, and \citet{niewoehner2025} suggest that connectivity influences learning environments, though limited improvements in SAT scores prior to 2014 \citep{hazlett2019} highlight the constraints of basic access. Earlier work by \citet{angrist2002}, \citet{angrist2009}, \citet{beuermann2013}, and \citet{duflo2012} indicates that technology adoption interacts with incentives; for example, \citet{duflo2012} finds that improved teacher attendance leads to test scores that are 0.17 standard deviations higher after one year. These findings suggest that the ability to increase skills of not only students but also teachers can create more opportunities to increase human capital formation.

\textit{Broadband Speed.} The quality of broadband, measured by speed, also affects educational delivery. \citet{boeri2023}, \citet{grimes2018}, and \citet{sanchis2021} demonstrate that higher-speed connections support advanced learning tools, with \citet{sanchis2021} reporting that a one-standard deviation increase in broadband speed raises test scores by 0.19 standard deviations. However, socioeconomic disparities and infrastructure readiness are critical moderators, meaning that speed benefits are not equally realized across all communities.

The pre-reform focus on connectivity \citep{hazlett2019} and the limited post-reform evaluation leave a significant gap in understanding the dynamic relationship between broadband technologies and human capital development across diverse socioeconomic and geographic contexts. This study addresses this gap by estimating the causal impact of the 2014 E-Rate modernization on graduation rates, college enrollment, and earnings, investigating how enhanced access and speed collectively reshape human capital formation. 

\textbf{Infrastructure Investments in School Environments and Learning Outcomes.}  The influence of school infrastructure on educational outcomes has long been a focus of empirical research. Early studies by \citet{berner1993}, \citet{cash1993}, and \citet{duran2008} establish that physical conditions, such as building quality and classroom environment, play a pivotal role in student performance and attendance. Subsequent work by \citet{maxwell1999}, \citet{hathaway1995}, and \citet{park2020} extends this to environmental factors like lighting and temperature. A study by \citet{park2020} finds that without air conditioning, a one degree hotter school year reduces that year’s learning by one percent. More recently, \citet{wanke2024} and \citet{daoud2021} emphasize the growing importance of technological infrastructure, including broadband and home internet, as mediators of educational success in a digital age. Together, these studies suggest that investments in both physical and technological assets can enhance educational quality, yet the specific role of broadband subsidies like E-Rate, particularly after the 2014 modernization, remains insufficiently addressed. The shift toward high-speed internet and Wi-Fi infrastructure under E-Rate introduces new dimensions to this literature, warranting further investigation into how these changes influence long-term attainment.

This study contributes by evaluating how the 2014 E-Rate modernization’s focus on broadband and Wi-Fi infrastructure impacts attainment outcomes, building on existing infrastructure research to examine the impact of broadband infrastructure and quality on educational outcomes.

\textbf{The Digital Divide and Heterogeneity in Broadband Access.}  Disparities in broadband access and quality across geographic and demographic lines persist. \citet{gallardo2022} and \citet{gallardo2024} document rural–urban and socioeconomic gaps, while \citet{li2023} finds that broadband access in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods was 10–15\% lower than in majority White or Asian neighborhoods. \citet{reddick2020} shows that lower-income and minority groups are more likely to have basic connectivity but rarely benefit from high-speed options due to affordability barriers. Historical studies (\citet{strover2001}, \citet{riddlesden2014},  \citet{kelley2020}) trace the evolution of these disparities in the U.S. and internationally. \citet{boeri2023} further notes that wealthier communities disproportionately access higher-speed broadband. 

This study advances the literature by analyzing how the 2014 E-Rate reforms mitigate digital disparities and contribute to attainment gains, particularly in underserved regions, aligning with the proposal’s emphasis on equity and rural development.
